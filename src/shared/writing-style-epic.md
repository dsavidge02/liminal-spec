# Writing Principle: Plain Description

## What It Is

Every sentence describes what something does, what it is, or where it fits. Nothing else. No framing, no selling, no justifying, no self-describing. Every word has a job. If you remove a word and the meaning doesn't change, the word shouldn't have been there.

The reader is a Tech Lead or Senior Engineer who needs to understand the system and build from the spec. They don't need to be convinced the project is worthwhile. They don't need a tour guide announcing what they're about to read. They need to know what the thing does so they can design it.

## What It Isn't

It isn't terse for the sake of brevity. Longer sentences are fine when every word earns its place — detailed descriptions of behavior, specific examples, enumerated capabilities. The principle isn't "be short." It's "don't waste the reader's time."

It also isn't a ban on context. Saying where something fits ("first of two epics"), what it replaces ("re-uploading replaces existing data"), or what it doesn't do ("stages 3-6 are inactive") is plain description. That's useful information. The line is: does this sentence describe the system, or does it describe how the reader should feel about the system?

## The Failure Modes

### 1. The Prologue

Writing that sets the scene before getting to the point. Background, history, the current pain, the journey to the solution. This is a spec, not a pitch deck.

**Bad:**
> Today, converting business rules from spreadsheets into executable application logic is a manual, team-intensive process — two offshore teams contracted for a year to work through ~1,300 rules across two product lines. There's no tooling to help. A developer reads each row, interprets the English condition, figures out what entity it maps to, and writes the code by hand.

Three sentences of archaeology. The reader doesn't need to understand the history of the problem to design the solution. This is justification — it belongs in a project proposal, not a epic.

**Good:**
> This feature provides the ability to upload a business rules spreadsheet, validate and parse each rule, and diagnose rule loading issues. This is the first half of an ETL process to convert business rules from the source workbook into executable validation rules.

What it does. Where it fits. Done.

### 2. The Brochure

Sentences that describe the value or benefit instead of the behavior. Words like "enables," "empowers," "provides orientation," "designed to be." The reader can figure out why something is useful — they need to know what it does.

**Bad:**
> It provides orientation — the dev always knows where they are in the process.

Selling the benefit of a progress bar. The first sentence already said what it does.

**Good:**
> The pipeline progress bar appears at the top of every page, showing all six stages with the current stage highlighted.

What it is. Where it is. What it shows. Stop.

**Bad:**
> After this epic ships, a dev team that previously needed months and offshore contractors to convert a spreadsheet of rules can do it in days.

This is a pitch. "Previously needed months" vs "can do it in days" is a sales comparison. The reader building the system doesn't need the before/after contrast.

### 3. The Tour Guide

Sentences that announce what comes next or describe the structure of the document itself. "This section covers..." or "This epic gives the dev team two new capabilities and a persistent assistant."

**Bad:**
> This epic gives the dev team two new capabilities and a persistent assistant:

Counting and categorizing before the list. The list does this job. The sentence is a tour guide standing in front of the exhibit saying "you're about to see three paintings."

**Good:**
Just go straight to the bullets. The heading "In Scope" is the only framing needed.

### 4. The Defensive Justification

Sentences that explain why a choice was made, preemptively defending it. "Not just the ones the pipeline uses immediately" or "supporting future reporting and analytics integration."

**Bad:**
> All fields from the workbook are preserved, not just the ones the pipeline uses immediately, supporting future reporting and analytics integration.

"Not just the ones..." is anticipating the question "why store fields you don't use?" and answering it preemptively. "Supporting future reporting" is justifying the decision. Neither describes the system.

**Good:**
> Every column from the workbook is preserved, including fields not used by current pipeline stages.

What it stores. How completely. Done. If someone wants to know why, they can ask.

### 5. The Ceremony

Extra words that add formality but no meaning. "Begins a rule loading session by," "This flow is designed to be re-run," "on demand."

**Bad:**
> The developer begins a rule loading session by selecting a product and version, uploading the business spreadsheet, and reviewing what the system found.

"Begins a rule loading session by" is ceremony. The developer isn't "beginning a session" — they're selecting a product, uploading a file, and reviewing results.

**Good:**
> The dev selects a product and version, uploads the spreadsheet, and reviews what the system found.

Same information. No ceremony.

**Bad:**
> This flow is designed to be re-run — uploading to a version that already has data replaces everything and starts fresh.

"This flow is designed to be re-run" is a meta-statement about the flow's design intent. The dash clause is the actual behavior.

**Good:**
> Re-uploading to a version with existing data replaces everything and starts fresh.

Just the behavior.

### 6. The Vague Benefit

Words that sound descriptive but don't actually specify anything. "Clear summary," "explain what the system found," "ask for help at any point."

**Bad:**
> Ask the AI assistant for help at any point — a chat sidebar available on every page that can answer questions about the data, explain what the system found, and provide quick summaries via one-click Quick Chat Links.

"Ask for help" is vague. "Explain what the system found" is vague — explain what about what it found? The specific parts (answers questions, Quick Chat Links) are buried after the vague parts.

**Good:**
> AI assistant chat sidebar — available on every page, answers questions about the data and provides quick summaries via one-click Quick Chat Links.

Starts with what it is. Says what it does. Specific throughout.

### 7. The Implementation Leak

Naming internal tools, specific function names, or return shapes when the requirement is about behavior the user sees.

**Bad:**
> `inspect_upload` returns summary data (total rows, sheets, valid count, problem count, duplicate count).

The functional requirement is that the AI can answer questions using upload data. The tool name is an implementation choice.

**Good:**
> Response includes relevant summary data (total rows, sheets, valid count, problem count, duplicate count).

Same specificity about what data is available. No opinion about how it's wired.

## The Test

For any sentence, ask: **does this describe the system, or does it describe something about the system?**

- "The progress bar shows six stages" → describes the system. Keep.
- "It provides orientation" → describes a quality of the system. Cut.
- "Upload a spreadsheet and see parsed results" → describes the system. Keep.
- "What used to take months starts taking days" → describes the value of the system. Cut.
- "Re-uploading replaces existing data" → describes the system. Keep.
- "This flow is designed to be re-run" → describes the intent behind the system. Cut.

If the sentence survives the test, check each word: remove it, re-read. Did the meaning change? No? The word goes.
