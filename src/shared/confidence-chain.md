## The Confidence Chain

Every line of code traces back through a chain:

```
AC (requirement) → TC (test condition) → Test (code) → Implementation
```

**Validation rule:** Can't write a TC? The AC is too vague. Can't write a test? The TC is too vague.

This chain is what makes the methodology traceable. When something breaks, you can trace from the failing test back to the TC, back to the AC, back to the requirement.
